# Pokémon Warp Red and Blue

This is a fork of the [**Pokémon Red and Blue disassembly**][pokered] by [**pret**][pret].

It introduces a "warp room" that allows for faster travel around Kanto.

To set up the repository, see [**INSTALL.md**](INSTALL.md).

MANY thanks to [**Luna**][luna] for all of the inspiration and guidance!
